# PWATextEditor

## Description

My motivation for creating this app was to be able to create a Manifest, service worker, and bundle code to create an offline app

I built this app in order to practice my ability to config webpack files, service files and to actually download and install an app that works offline.

I learned how to navigate and trouble through the types of errors that could come up when working with service workers and webpackaging.

## Installation
